# Getting Started with Customer Scheduling Information on Graph

## How it works-

1. After running the app it will take a date as an input and then it will show all the customer scheduling of 3 days before. This will be shown on a bar chart [ChartByDate](./src/Components/Charts/ChartByDate.js)

2. Also you can click on individual bars of date of first chart to see the items scheduled by time. This will open a new bar chart showing time-duration and number of schedules on [ChartByTime](./src/Components/Charts/ChartByTime.js)

## Steps for setup

1. Download and extract it.
2. Open terminal and run following commands-

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

- Runs the app and it will automatically download all the dependencies.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- The page will reload when you make changes.
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
